# AWS-CloudFormation-Sample-Templates
Feel free to use these sample templates. If you notice any inconsistencies or if you come across a better way of creating any of the resources, please comment or reach out to me. It's a great opportunity for me to learn as well. Before launching a template, always review the resources that it will create and the permissions it requires.
